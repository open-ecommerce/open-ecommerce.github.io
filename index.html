					<h2>About open ecommerce, Website Development</h2>
					<p>We are a group of independent developers, specialized in Open Source platforms as Magento, Joomla and Wordpress working from our studio in London.</p>
					<p>Open e-commerce was set up as a social enterprise. Our projects are united by a common underlying idea. Everything we do aims to empower people and go along them in the path to realize their projects.</p>
					<p>Part of the income from our Agency work goes to create links with the community and develop community projects. So far we have engaged with projects in South America, and more recently European and UK-based projects. This is our philosophy.&nbsp;</p>

							<h2 class="title1 upper">We promote open source technology</h2>
							<p>Open Source technology is free, which means you donâ€™t pay to use it in your private or commercial projects. Open Source belongs to the community of users. If an application becomes widespread in the community there will be more people using it
								and more people supporting each other. Because it is Open Source any developer can contribute to it and create new functionality. This makes the product become better and better every day.</p>
